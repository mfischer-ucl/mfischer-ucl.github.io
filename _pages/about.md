Hi! I'm Michael, a research scientist at <a href="https://research.adobe.com/">Adobe Research</a> London. 
My research focuses on intelligent optimization, inverse rendering and 3D understanding.  

I am also finalizing my PhD at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk">UCL</a>,
supervised by <a href="http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucactri">Tobias Ritschel</a> and <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra">Niloy Mitra</a>. 

<br/> 

<br/>

I received my B.Sc. in Aerospace Information Technology from the <a href="https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/startseite">University of Wuerzburg</a>,

under the supervision of <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/aerospaceinfo/mitarbeiter/montenegro">Sergio Montenegro</a>.

Subsequently, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science with focus on intelligent systems as a honors student and have 

been working with <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/datascience/staff/kobs">Konstantin Kobs</a> and <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/datascience/staff/hotho">Andreas Hotho</a>.
Moreover, I spent a semester abroad at <a href="https://www.udg.mx">UDG</a> in Guadalajara, Mexico.
<br/>

During the summer of 2024, I interned at <a href="https://research.adobe.com/">Adobe Research</a> London as a research scientist working on <a href="/sama">3D-consistent material-selection</a> with <a href="https://valentin.deschaintre.fr/">Valentin Deschaintre</a>! 
In 2023, I spent some time at <a href="https://about.meta.com/uk/realitylabs">Meta Reality Labs</a> in Redmond, Washington, where I joined the Neural / Inverse Rendering team around Carl Marshall and <a href="http://www.flycooler.com/">Zhao Dong</a> as a summer intern to work on <a href="/nerf_analogies">NeRF Analogies</a>. 
I've also interned at <a href="https://www.mbda-deutschland.de">MBDA Germany</a>, where I worked on reinforcement-learning 
based swarm control.

My hobbies include travelling, climbing, cooking, diving and making music! Feel free to check out my social media - links are provided to the left of this page. <br/>
