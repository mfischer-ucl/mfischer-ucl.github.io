Hi! I'm Michael, a first-year PhD student in AI and Computer Graphics at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a>.
I am working with <a href="http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucactri">Tobias Ritschel</a> and <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra">Niloy Mitra</a>
to research deep and efficient representations of high-fidelity graphic assets. 
Currently, my research focuses on appearance decompositions and meta-learning. <br> 

I received my B.Sc. in Aerospace Information Technology from the <a href="https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/startseite">University of Wuerzburg</a>,
under the supervision of <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/aerospaceinfo/mitarbeiter/montenegro">Sergio Montenegro</a>.
Subsequently, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science with focus on intelligent systems and have 
been working with <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/datascience/staff/kobs">Konstantin Kobs</a> and <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/datascience/staff/hotho">Andreas Hotho</a>. 
I spent a summer at <a href="https://www.mbda-deutschland.de">MBDA Germany</a>, where I researched the potential of reinforcement learning for 
automated swarm control. <br>

My hobbies include travelling, cooking and making music! Feel free to check out my social media - links are provided to the left of this page.
