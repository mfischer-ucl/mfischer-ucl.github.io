Hi, I'm Michael Fischer, a first-year PhD student in AI and Computer Graphics at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).
I am working with [Tobias Ritschel](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucactri/) and [Niloy Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra/)
to research deep and efficient representations of high-fidelity graphic assets. 
Currently, my research focuses on appearance decompositions and meta-learning.

I received my B.Sc. in Aerospace Information Technology from the [University of Wuerzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/startseite)
, under the supervision of [Sergio Montenegro](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/aerospaceinfo/mitarbeiter/montenegro).
Subsequently, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science with focus on intelligent systems under the supervision, and have 
been working with [Konstantin Kobs](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/datascience/staff/kobs) and [Andreas Hotho](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/datascience/staff/hotho). 
I spent a summer at MBDA Germany, where I researched the potential of reinforcement learning for 
automated swarm control.
